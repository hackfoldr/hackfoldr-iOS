# hackfoldr-iOS #

This is a simple iOS client for [hackfoldr](https://github.com/hackfoldr/hackfoldr)

## Why? ##

Hackfoldr on mobile is simply not good enough on iOS.

## Use CocoaPods developer ##

[CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org/) is the easy way to install third-party iOS components.

````
pod install
````

## Use Git-flow for teamwork ##
